As an AI R&D Engineer at [PARADOX CAT](https://paradoxcat.com/en), I lead a small team of developers working on innovative AI projects for automotive in-cabin sensing and human-machine interaction.
We implement Computer Vision and radar algorithms to support our customers like BMW in PoC and series development projects.

My background is in Space Physics, in which I completed my PhD in the [Extraterrestrial Physics Group](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/et) at
the University of Kiel in 2021.
During my studies, I have been part of the scientific teams of the [Solar Orbiter Energetic Particle Detector](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/ag-wimmer/solo),
and the [Radiation Assessment Detector](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/ag-wimmer/msl) on Mars Science Laboratory. You can find links to my scientific publications and presentations on this website.
