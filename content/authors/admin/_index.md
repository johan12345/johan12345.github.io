Since March 2021, I am working as a software developer at [Paradox Cat GmbH](https://paradoxcat.com/en), developing prototypes for the automotive industry using Machine Learning technologies at BMW BetaLabs in Munich.

My background is in Space Science, in which I got my PhD in the [Extraterrestrial Physics Group](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/et) at
Kiel University. During my PhD studies, I have been part of the scientific team of the
[RAD](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/ag-wimmer/msl) instrument on the *Curiosity* rover on Mars,
and the [Solar Orbiter Energetic Particle Detector](https://www.physik.uni-kiel.de/de/institute/ieap/ag-wimmer/solo). You can find links to my scientific publications and presentations on this website.
