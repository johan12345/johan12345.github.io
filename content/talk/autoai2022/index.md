summary:
abstract: |
    - How can we optimize ML models to maximize the efficiency during inference in the car?
    - What are the challenges of deploying active and federated learning systems in the car? What can we learn from similar applications in the development of autonomous vehicles and associated tech?
    - How can the car accurately detect the occupant’s behavior and intention? How can we leverage this information in autonomous vehicle control/path planning for creating human-like behaviors that intelligently adapt the driving style?
    - How can we deal better with false positives when working with natural interaction modes such as gestures and voice?
    - Which interior cabin sensors leverage the most from machine learning for gesture control?
