abstract: "
The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth’s orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5
AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations.

The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts cause the so-called Forbush
decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) intensity measured on-ground or on
a spacecraft. This effect can be used to detect the passage of ICMEs at various locations in the heliosphere, for
example at Earth (using neutron monitors), the STEREO A and B spacecraft (HET) as well the on the surface of
Mars using the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover.

A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or B) and Mars
locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase).
Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs’ transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by determining the time delay
between the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of the
ICME propagation speeds before and after passing Earth’s orbit and find that their deceleration due to interaction
with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution
among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results
are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and
ENLIL plus cone model.
