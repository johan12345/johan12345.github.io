We identify ICME events that could be unambiguously followed with the STEREO-A heliospheric imagers during their interplanetary propagation to their impact at the aforementioned spacecraft and look for events where the same ICME is seen in situ by widely separated spacecraft. We highlight two events: (1) a small streamer blowout CME on 2020 June 23 observed with a triple lineup by PSP, BepiColombo and Wind, guided by imaging with STEREO-A, and (2) the first fast CME of solar cycle 25 (≈1600 km s−1) on 2020 November 29 observed in situ by PSP and STEREO-A. These results are useful for modeling the magnetic structure of ICMEs and the interplanetary evolution and global shape of their flux ropes and shocks, and for studying the propagation of solar energetic particles.

In preparation for future human exploration, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was designed to detect and analyze the most biologically hazardous energetic particle radiation on the Martian surface as part of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. RAD has measured the deep space radiation field within the spacecraft during the cruise to Mars and the cosmic ray induced energetic particle radiation on Mars since Curiosity’s landing in August 2012. These first-ever surface radiation data have been continuously providing a unique and direct assessment of the radiation environment on Mars. We analyze the temporal variation of the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) radiation and the observed Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events measured by RAD from the launch of MSL until December 2020, i.e., from the pre-maximum of solar cycle 24 throughout its solar minimum until the initial year of Cycle 25. Over the long term, the Mars’s surface GCR radiation increased by about 50% due to the declining solar activity and the weakening heliospheric magnetic field. At different time scales in a shorter term, RAD also detected dynamic variations in the radiation field on Mars. We present and quantify the temporal changes of the radiation field which are mainly caused by: (a) heliospheric influences which include both temporary impacts by solar transients and the long-term solar cycle evolution, (b) atmospheric changes which include the Martian daily thermal tide and seasonal CO₂ cycle as well as the altitude change of the rover, (c) topographical changes along the rover path-way causing addition structural shielding and finally (d) solar particle events which occur sporadically and may significantly enhance the radiation within a short time period. Quantification of the variation allows the estimation of the accumulated radiation for a return trip to the surface of Mars under various conditions. The accumulated GCR dose equivalent, via a Hohmann transfer, is about 0.65±0.24 sievert and 1.59±0.1 sievert during solar maximum and minimum periods, respectively. The shielding of the GCR radiation by heliospheric magnetic fields during solar maximum periods is rather efficient in reducing the total GCR-induced radiation for a Mars mission, by more than 50%. However, further contributions by SEPs must also be taken into account. In the future, with advanced nuclear thrusters via a fast transfer, we estimate that the total GCR dose equivalent can be reduced to about 0.2 sievert and 0.5 sievert during solar maximum and minimum periods respectively. In addition, we also examined factors which may further reduce the radiation dose in space and on Mars and discuss the many uncertainties in the interpreting the biological effect based on the current measurement.

In mid-June the Solar Orbiter (SolO) mission reached its first perihelion at 0.51 au and started its cruise phase, with most of the in-situ instruments operating continuously. Aims. We present the in-situ particle measurements of the first proton event observed after the first perihelion obtained by the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) suite onboard SolO. The potential solar and interplanetary (IP) sources of these particles are investigated. Methods. Ion observations from ∼20 keV to ∼1 MeV are combined with available solar wind data from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument and magnetic field data from the magnetometer (MAG) onboard SolO to evaluate the energetic particle transport conditions and infer the possible acceleration mechanisms through which particles gain energy. We compare  17 – 20 MeV count rate measurements for two solar rotations, along with the solar wind plasma data available from the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and RPW instruments, in order to infer the origin of the observed galactic cosmic ray (GCR) depressions. Results. The lack of an observed electron event and of velocity dispersion at various low-energy ion channels, and the observed IP structure indicate a local IP source for the low-energy particles. From the analysis of the anisotropy of particle intensities, we conclude that, most likely, the low-energy ions were accelerated via a local second-order Fermi process. The observed GCR decrease on 19 June, together with the 51.8 – 1034.0 keV/nuc ion enhancement, was due to a solar wind stream interaction region (SIR). The observation of a similar GCR decrease in the next solar rotation favours this interpretation, and constitutes the first observation of a recurrent GCR decrease by SolO. The analysis of the recurrence times of this SIR suggests that it is the same SIR responsible for the 4He events previously measured in April and May. Finally, we point out that a more complex IP structure than a common SIR cannot be discarded, mainly due to the lack of solar wind temperature measurements and of a higher cadence of solar wind velocity observations.

Solar Orbiter promises to unveil how the Sun controls and shapes the heliosphere and fills it with energetic particle radiation. To this end, its Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) has now been operating and providing excellent data for just over a year. Aims. EPD measures suprathermal and energetic particles in the energy range from a few keV up to (near-) relativistic energies (few MeV for electrons and about 500 MeV/nuc for ions). We present an overview of initial results from the first year of operations and provide a first assessment of issues and limitations, but also present areas where EPD excels and provides opportunities for significant scientific progress in understanding how our Sun shapes the heliosphere. Methods. We use the solar particle events observed by Solar Orbiter on 21 July and 10/11 December 2020 to discuss the capabilities, updates on them, and open issues of EPD on Solar Orbiter. We also give some words of caution and caveats about how to use data from the EPD. Results. During this first year of the Solar Orbiter mission, EPD has recorded several particle events at distances between 0.5 and 1 au from the Sun. We present dynamic and time-averaged energy spectra for ions which were measured with a combination of all four EPD sensors (the SupraThermal Electron and Proton sensor (STEP), the Electron Proton Telescope (EPT), the Supathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), and the High- Energy Telescope (HET)) and associated energy spectra for electrons measured with STEP and EPT.We illustrate the capabilities of the EPD suite using the 10/11 December 2020 solar particle event. This event showed an enrichment of heavy ions as well as 3He for which we also present dynamic spectra measured with SIS. The high anisotropy of electrons at the onset of the event and its temporal evolution is also shown using data from these sensors. We discuss the ongoing in-flight calibration and a few open instrumental issues using data from the 21 July and the 10/11 December 2020 events and give guidelines and examples for the usage of the EPD data. We explain how spacecraft operations may affect EPD data and present a list of such time periods in the appendix.

The Metis coronagraph is one of the remote sensing instruments hosted on board the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter mission. Metis is devoted to carry out the first simultaneous imaging of the solar corona in both visible light (VL) and ultraviolet (UV). High-energy particles can penetrate spacecraft materials and may limit the performance of the on-board instruments. A study of the galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) tracks observed in the first VL images gathered by Metis during the commissioning phase is presented here. A similar analysis is planned for the UV channel. Aims. We aim to formulate a prediction of the GCR flux up to hundreds of GeV for the first part of the Solar Orbiter mission to study the performance of the Metis coronagraph. Methods. The GCR model predictions are compared to observations gathered on board Solar Orbiter by the High-Energy Telescope in the range between 10 MeV-100 MeV in the summer of 2020 as well as with the previous measurements. Estimated cosmic-ray fluxes above 70 MeV n−1 have been also parameterized and used for Monte Carlo simulations aimed at reproducing the cosmic-ray track observations in the Metis coronagraph VL images. The same parameterizations can also be used to study the performance of other detectors. Results. By comparing observations of cosmic-ray tracks in the Metis VL images with FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of cosmic-ray interactions in the VL detector, we find that cosmic rays fire only a fraction, on the order of 10−4 , of the whole image pixel sample. We also find that the overall efficiency for cosmic-ray identification in the Metis VL images is approximately equal to the contribution of Z2 GCR particles. A similar study will be carried out during the whole of the Solar Orbiter’s mission duration for the purposes of instrument diagnostics and to verify whether the Metis data and Monte Carlo simulations would allow for a long-term monitoring of the GCR proton flux.

On 2020 November 29, the first widespread solar energetic particle (SEP) event of solar cycle 25 was observed at four widely separated locations in the inner (. 1 AU) heliosphere. Relativistic electrons as well as protons with energies  50 MeV were observed by Solar Orbiter (SolO), Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A and multiple near-Earth spacecraft. The SEP event was associated with an M4.4 class X-ray flare and accompanied by a coronal mass ejection (CME) and an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave as well as a type II radio burst and multiple type III radio bursts. Aims. We present multi-spacecraft particle observations and place them in context with source observations from remote sensing instruments and discuss how such observations may further our understanding of particle acceleration and transport in this widespread event. Methods. Velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time shift analysis (TSA) were used to infer the particle release times at the Sun. Solar wind plasma and magnetic field measurements were examined to identify structures that influence the properties of the energetic particles such as their intensity. Pitch angle distributions and first-order anisotropies were analyzed in order to characterize the particle propagation in the interplanetary medium. Results. We find that during the 2020 November 29 SEP event, particles spread over more than 230° in longitude close to 1 AU. The particle onset delays observed at the different spacecraft are larger as the flare–footpoint angle increases and are consistent with those from previous STEREO observations. Comparing the timing when the EUV wave intersects the estimated magnetic footpoints of each spacecraft with particle release times from TSA and VDA, we conclude that a simple scenario where the particle release is only determined by the EUV wave propagation is unlikely for this event. Observations of anisotropic particle distributions at SolO, Wind, and STEREO-A do not rule out that particles are injected over a wide longitudinal range close to the Sun. However, the low values of the first-order anisotropy observed by near-Earth spacecraft suggest that diffusive propagation processes are likely involved.

The period consists of several well-resolved ion injections. The high-resolution STEREO-A imaging observations reveal that the injections coincide with EUV jets/brightenings near the east limb, not far from the nominal magnetic connection of Solar Orbiter. The jets originated in two adjacent, large, and complex active regions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory when the regions rotated to the Earth’s view.

Bursty suprathermal ion enhancements (up to ~10 keV) were observed as far as ~50 RV downtail. These enhancements are likely related to a combination of acceleration mechanisms in regions of strong turbulence, current sheet crossings, and boundary layer crossings, with a possible instance of ion heating due to ion cyclotron waves within the Venusian tail. Upstream of the planet, suprathermal ions are observed that might be related to pick-up acceleration of photoionized exospheric populations as far as 5 RV upstream in the solar wind as has been observed before by missions such as Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Venus Express. Near the closest approach of Solar Orbiter, the Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) count rate was observed to decrease by approximately 5 percent, consistent with the amount of sky obscured by the planet, suggesting a negligible abundance of GCR albedo particles at over 2 RV . Along with modulation of the GCR population very close to Venus, the Solar Orbiter observations show that the Venusian system, even far from the planet, can be an effective accelerator of ions up to ~30 keV. This paper is part of a series of first papers from the Solar Orbiter Venus flyby; Volwerk et al. (2021) further discusses the magnetic field observations, Hadid et al. (2021) focuses on observations from the radio and plasma waves instrument, and Dimmock et al. (2021) focuses on characterizing the bow shock.

The observations of the stealth CME at the Sun are compared with the magnetic field measured by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, and plasma properties measured by the Wind spacecraft. Results. The source of the CME is found to be a quiet Sun cavity in the northern hemisphere. We find that the stealth CME has a strong magnetic field in situ, despite originating from a quiet Sun region with an extremely weak magnetic field. Conclusions. The interaction of the ICME with its surrounding environment is the likely cause of a higher magnetic field strength measured in situ. Stealth CMEs require multi-wavelength and multi-viewpoint observations in order to confidently locate the source region, however their elusive signatures still pose many problems for space weather forecasting.

We present observations of the first coronal mass ejection (CME) observed at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft on April 19, 2020, and the associated Forbush decrease (FD) measured by its High Energy Telescope (HET). This CME is a multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods. We highlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of the galactic cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The analytical ForbMod model is applied to the FD measurements to reproduce the Forbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for the model are derived from both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The very slow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the low-energy cosmic ray measurements at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor measurements. Significant differences are observed in the expansion behavior of the CME at different locations, which may be related to influence of the following high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions, ForbMod is able to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from HET as well as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not agree with the FD amplitudes at higher energies measured by neutron monitors on Earth. We study these discrepancies and provide possible explanations. Conclusions. This study highlights that the novel measurements of the Solar Orbiter can be coordinated with other spacecraft to improve our understanding of space weather in the inner heliosphere. Multi-spacecraft observations combined with data-based modeling are also essential to understand the propagation and evolution of CMEs as well as their space weather impacts.

Solar Orbiter, launched in February 2020, started its cruise phase in June 2020, in coincidence with its first perihelion at 0.51 au from the Sun. The in situ instruments onboard, including the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), operate continuously during the cruise phase enabling the observation of solar energetic particles. Aims. In situ measurements of the first near-relativistic solar electron events observed in July 2020 by EPD are analyzed and the solar origins and the conditions for the interplanetary transport of these particles investigated. Methods. Electron observations from keV energies to the near-relativistic range were combined with the detection of type III radio bursts and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from multiple spacecraft in order to identify the solar origin of the electron events. Electron anisotropies and timing as well as the plasma and magnetic field environment were evaluated to characterize the interplanetary transport conditions. Results. All electron events were clearly associated with type III radio bursts. EUV jets were also found in association with all of them except one. A diversity of time profiles and pitch-angle distributions was observed. Different source locations and different magnetic connectivity and transport conditions were likely involved. The July 11 event was also detected by Wind, separated 107 degrees in longitude from Solar Orbiter. For the July 22 event, the Suprathermal Electron and Proton (STEP) sensor of EPD allowed for us to not only resolve multiple electron injections at low energies, but it also provided an exceptionally high pitch-angle resolution of a very anisotropic beam. This, together with radio observations of local Langmuir waves suggest a very good magnetic connection during the July 22 event. This scenario is challenged by a high-frequency occultation of the type III radio burst and a nominally non-direct connection to the source; therefore, magnetic connectivity requires further investigation.

These events are one of the most important space weather phenomena. Their strong and turbulent magnetic field can cause disruptions of spacecraft electronics as well as terrestrial infrastructure, and they can be associated with the acceleration of energetic particles, which may cause increased radiation exposure, e.g. for astronauts. To be able to validate and consequently improve theoretical models predicting the arrival of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at Earth and other locations in the heliosphere, it is important to employ many different data sources measuring the various signatures of ICMEs at different locations, so that their temporal and radial evolution can be studied. These investigations are also significantly aided by observations from remote sensing telescopes, which can directly observe the global structure of the ICMEs and track them out to large radial distances.  The studies presented in this thesis introduce Mars into the framework of routinely available locations for the in situ observation of space weather. Here, ICMEs can be detected using Forbush decrease measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. Forbush decreases are short-term decreases in the galactic cosmic ray flux caused by the magnetic structure of the ICME partly shielding away the cosmic rays. The measurements of these Forbush decreases are utilized in this thesis to determine ICME arrival times for statistical studies of events seen at two planets, Earth and Mars, or at one of the two STEREO spacecraft and Mars, during close longitudinal alignment. The measurements show for the first time that fast ICMEs can continue to decelerate beyond the orbit of Earth due to their interaction with the slower ambient solar wind. Using remote sensing observations from the STEREO heliospheric imagers, we study additional ICMEs that hit Mars and benchmark the accuracy of different approaches for the analysis of these heliospheric imager data. Subsequently, the Forbush decrease data for the thereby cataloged events are further investigated to infer not only the arrival time, but also more information about the radial evolution of the ICME properties by comparison with analytical modeling approaches.  Finally, two case studies are performed: First, the major space weather events of September 2017 and their impact on Mars are examined, including the investigation of the solar energetic particle events and three associated CMEs that interacted and merged on their way towards Mars. Second, the first in situ observations of an ICME at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, which launched in February 2020, are presented. In this study, we describe the capabilities of the Solar Orbiter's High Energy Telescope for high-resolution observations of Forbush decreases and use its measurements in combination with a reverse modeling approach to show that the expansion of the ICME was non-uniform, possibly due to interaction with a following solar wind stream interaction region.","tags":["Coronal mass ejections; interplanetary coronal mass ejections; cme; icme; solar orbiter; mars science laboratory; msl; forbush decreases; radiation assessment detector; rad; high energy telescope; het; stereo; heliospheric imager"],"title":"Multipoint observations of ICMEs in the inner heliosphere: Forbush decreases and remote sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Glenn M.

Combined proton energy spectra are studied based on the LND, SOHO/EPHIN, and ACE/EPAM measurements, which show that LND could provide a complementary data set from a special location on the Moon, contributing to our existing observations and understanding of space environment. We applied velocity dispersion analysis to the impulsive electron event and weak proton enhancement and show that electrons are released only 22 minutes after the flare onset and ∼15 minutes after the type II radio burst, while protons are released more than one hour after the electron release. The beam-like in situ electrons and clear velocity dispersion indicate a good magnetic connection between the source and Earth. This is remarkable because stereoscopic remote-sensing observations from Earth and STEREO-A suggest that the SEPs are associated with an active region nearly 113° away from the magnetic footpoint of Earth. This suggests that these SEPs did not propagate along the nominal Parker spiral normally assumed for ballistic mapping and that the release and propagation mechanism of electrons and protons are likely to differ significantly for this event.","tags":[],"title":"First Solar Energetic Particles Measured on the Lunar Far-side","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shenyi Zhang","Robert F.

While the prediction of their arrival time at Earth and other locations in the heliosphere is still a complex task, it is also necessary to further understand the time evolution of their geometric and magnetic structure, which is even more challenging considering the limited number of available observation points.\nForbush decreases (FDs), short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), can be caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, such as ICMEs and their associated shock/sheath regions. In the past, FD observations have often been used to determine the arrival times of ICMEs at different locations in the solar system, especially where sufficient solar wind plasma and magnetic field measurements are not (or not always) available. One of these locations is Mars, where the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission's Curiosity rover has been continuously measuring GCRs and FDs on the surface for more than 7 years.\nIn this work, we investigate whether FD data can be used to derive additional information about the ICME properties than just the arrival time by performing a statistical study based on catalogs of FDs observed at Earth or Mars. In particular, we find that the linear correlation between the FD amplitude and the maximum steepness, which was already seen at Earth by previous authors (Belov et al., 2008, Abunin et al., 2012), is likewise present at Mars, but with a different proprtionality factor.\nBy consulting physics-based analytical models of FDs, we find that this quantity is not expected to be influenced by the different energy ranges of GCR particles observed by the instruments at Earth and Mars. Instead, we suggest that the difference in FD characteristics at the two planets is caused by the radial enlargement of the ICMEs, and particularly their sheath regions, as they propagate from Earth (1 AU) to Mars (~ 1.5 AU). This broadening factor derived from our analysis extends observations for the evolution closer to the Sun by Janvier et al. (2019, JGR Space Physics) to larger heliocentric distances and is consistent with these results.

Such events can be observed at Earth, for example, using neutron monitors, and also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory. They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or corotating interaction regions, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modeling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.","tags":["Icme","Forbush decrease","Gcr","Msl","Mars mission","Radiation"],"title":"Comparing the Properties of ICME-Induced Forbush Decreases at Earth and Mars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Annex","Ben Pearson","Benoît Seignovert","Brian Carcich","Helge Eichhorn","Jesse Mapel","Johan L.

We link 45 of the events observed at STEREO-HI to their corresponding FDs at MSL/RAD and study the accuracy of the ICME arrival time at Mars predicted from HI data using different methods. The mean differences between the predicted arrival times and those observed using FDs range from −11–5 hr for the different methods, with standard deviations between 17 and 20 hr. These values for predictions at Mars are very similar compared to other locations closer to the Sun and also comparable to the precision of some other modeling approaches.","tags":["Space weather","Stereo","Coronal mass ejection","Forbush decrease","Msl/rad"],"title":"Tracking and Validating ICMEs Propagating Toward Mars Using STEREO Heliospheric Imagers Combined With Forbush Decreases Detected by MSL/RAD","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544792400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544792400,"objectID":"c7484b8e45836dcdcb70288790535c07","permalink":"https://johan.vonforst.net/talk/agu2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-14T08:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/agu2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tracking and validating ICMEs propagating towards Mars using STEREO Heliospheric Imagers combined with Forbush decreases detected by MSL/RAD","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jingnan Guo","Mateja Dumbović","Robert F.

The ground level enhancement on the surface of Mars, 160 longitudinally east of Earth, observed by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was the largest since the landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012. Based on multipoint coronagraph images and the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model, we identify the initial 3-D kinematics of an extremely fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and its shock front, as well as another two CMEs launched hours earlier with moderate speeds. The three CMEs interacted as they propagated outward into the heliosphere and merged into a complex interplanetary CME (ICME). The arrival of the shock and ICME at Mars caused a very significant Forbush decrease seen by RAD only a few hours later than that at Earth, which was about 0.5 AU closer to the Sun. We investigate the propagation of the three CMEs and the merged ICME together with the shock, using the drag-based model and the WSA-ENLIL plus cone model constrained by the in situ observations. The synergistic study of the ICME and solar energetic particle arrivals at Earth and Mars suggests that to better predict potentially hazardous space weather impacts at Earth and other heliospheric locations for human exploration missions, it is essential to analyze (1) the eruption of the flare and CME at the Sun, (2) the CME kinematics, especially during their interactions, and (3) the spatially and temporally varying heliospheric conditions, such as the evolution and propagation of the stream interaction regions.","tags":["Coronal mass ejection (cme)","Interplanetary shock","Solar energetic particle (sep)","Ground level enhancement (gle)","Planetary space weather","Multispacecraft measurement"],"title":"Modeling the Evolution and Propagation of 10 September 2017 CMEs and SEPs Arriving at Mars Constrained by Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cary Zeitlin","Donald M.

Using this data, we can detect Forbush decreases caused by ICMEs passing Mars. To gain a better understanding of the propagation of individual ICMEs from 1 AU (Earth orbit) to 1.5 AU (Mars orbit), we investigate events that took place close to the oppositions of Earth (as well as STEREO A and B) and Mars, i.e., when they were nearly in a straight line on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane. Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs’ transit time by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases between data from Earth's orbit (such as neutron monitors on Earth and HEP on both STEREOs) and Mars (RAD). Based on the radial distance between the two measurement locations, the ambient solar wind speeds and the properties of these ICMEs determined in previous studies, we investigate the evolution of the ICME’s speed and/or shape during its propagation in the interplanetary medium beyond Earth orbit.
