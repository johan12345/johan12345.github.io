 abstract = {The first orbit of Solar Orbiter provided comprehensive measurements of six corotating interaction regions (CIRs) within 1 au. Five
of these CIRs were also observed by ACE at 1 au, allowing for comparisons of the suprathermal ion intensities and spectra at different
radial distances. Only subtle modulations of the 4He spectral slopes are observed between Solar Orbiter and ACE. Additionally, the
radial gradients of 226 - 320 keV/nuc 4He ion intensities between Solar Orbiter and ACE are similar to that of 1.53 MeV H reported
by Van Hollebeke et al. (1978). These observations provide a new addition to the study of the radial dependence of CIR-associated
suprathermal ions in the inner heliosphere.},
