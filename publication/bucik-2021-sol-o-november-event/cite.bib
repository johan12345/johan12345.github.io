 abstract = {
We report observations of a relatively long period of ³He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) measured by Solar Orbiter. The period
consists of several well-resolved ion injections. The high-resolution STEREO-A imaging observations reveal that the injections coincide
with EUV jets/brightenings near the east limb, not far from the nominal magnetic connection of Solar Orbiter. The jets originated
in two adjacent, large, and complex active regions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory when the regions rotated to the
Earth’s view. It appears that the sustained ion injections were related to the complex configuration of the sunspot group and the long
period of 3He-rich SEPs to the longitudinal extent covered by the group during the analyzed time period.
