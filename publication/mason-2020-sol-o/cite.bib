 abstract = {
We report observations of five impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed inside 1 au during the first perihelion pass
of the Solar Orbiter mission, which was launched in February 2020. These small events were all reasonably associated with active
regions observed from Earth but which had rotated out of view by the time of the Solar Orbiter observations. Even though most of
the events were small, their spectral forms, 3He content, and association with type III bursts convincingly identifies them as 3He-rich
impulsive SEP events with properties similar to those previously observed at 1 au. Three of the events showed fast ion rise times, and
two of them had long-lasting anisotropies consistent with the Compton-Getting effect.
