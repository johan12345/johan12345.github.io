Context. Following a multi-year minimum of solar activity, a solar energetic particle event on 2020 Nov. 29 was
observed by multiple spacecraft covering a wide range of solar longitudes including ACE, the Solar Terrestrial
Observatory-A (STEREO-A), and the recently launched Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SOLO).
Aims. Multi-point observations of a solar particle event, combined with remote-sensing imaging of flaring, shocks and
coronal mass ejections allow a global picture of the event to be synthesized, and used by the modeling community to
test, constrain, and refine models of particle acceleration and transport according to parameters such as shock
geometries and particle mass-to-charge ratios.
Methods. Measuring detailed heavy ion intensities, time dependence, fluences, and spectral slopes provide the
required test data.
Results. The heavy ion abundances, timing, and spectral forms for this event fall well within the range found in prior
surveys at 1 au. Spectra were well fitted by broken power law shapes; the Fe/O ratio was somewhat lower that the
average of other events. 3He/4He was very low, with only upper limits established.
