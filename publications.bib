  abstract = {The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so-called Forbush decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.},

Despite 23 g/cm2 of CO2 shielding provided by the atmosphere above RAD, dose rates rose above background galactic cosmic ray levels by factors of 2 to 3 over the course of several hours and leveled off at sustained peak rates for about 12 hr before declining over the following 36 hr. As the solar particle event flux was gradually declining, a shock front reached Mars and caused a sudden drop of about 15\% in instantaneous dose rates. No solar particles followed the shock arrival, and the magnetic shielding of galactic cosmic rays by the shock reduced their intensity to levels below those seen before the start of the event. This event is the largest seen to date by RAD on Mars.}

abstract = {On 10 September 2017, solar energetic particles originating from the active region 12673 produced a ground level enhancement at Earth. The ground level enhancement on the surface of Mars, 160 longitudinally east of Earth, observed by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was the largest since the landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012. Based on multipoint coronagraph images and the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model, we identify the initial 3-D kinematics of an extremely fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and its shock front, as well as another two CMEs launched hours earlier with moderate speeds. The three CMEs interacted as they propagated outward into the heliosphere and merged into a complex interplanetary CME (ICME). The arrival of the shock and ICME at Mars caused a very significant Forbush decrease seen by RAD only a few hours later than that at Earth, which was about 0.5 AU closer to the Sun. We investigate the propagation of the three CMEs and the merged ICME together with the shock, using the drag-based model and the WSA-ENLIL plus cone model constrained by the in situ observations. The synergistic study of the ICME and solar energetic particle arrivals at Earth and Mars suggests that to better predict potentially hazardous space weather impacts at Earth and other heliospheric locations for human exploration missions, it is essential to analyze (1) the eruption of the flare and CME at the Sun, (2) the CME kinematics, especially during their interactions, and (3) the spatially and temporally varying heliospheric conditions, such as the evolution and propagation of the stream interaction regions.},

abstract = {Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays, are caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions. Such events can be observed at Earth, for example, using neutron monitors, and also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory. They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or corotating interaction regions, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modeling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.},

Combined proton energy spectra are studied based on the LND, SOHO/EPHIN, and ACE/EPAM measurements, which show that LND could provide a complementary data set from a special location on the Moon, contributing to our existing observations and understanding of space environment. We applied velocity dispersion analysis to the impulsive electron event and weak proton enhancement and show that electrons are released only 22 minutes after the flare onset and ∼15 minutes after the type II radio burst, while protons are released more than one hour after the electron release. The beam-like in situ electrons and clear velocity dispersion indicate a good magnetic connection between the source and Earth. This is remarkable because stereoscopic remote-sensing observations from Earth and STEREO-A suggest that the SEPs are associated with an active region nearly 113° away from the magnetic footpoint of Earth. This suggests that these SEPs did not propagate along the nominal Parker spiral normally assumed for ballistic mapping and that the release and propagation mechanism of electrons and protons are likely to differ significantly for this event.}

    Aims. We present observations of the first coronal mass ejection (CME) observed at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft on April 19, 2020, and the associated Forbush decrease (FD) measured by its High Energy Telescope (HET). This CME is a multispacecraft event also seen near Earth the next day. Methods. We highlight the capabilities of HET for observing small short-term variations of the galactic cosmic ray count rate using its single detector counters. The analytical ForbMod model is applied to the FD measurements to reproduce the Forbush decrease at both locations. Input parameters for the model are derived from both in situ and remote-sensing observations of the CME. Results. The very slow (~350 km/s) stealth CME caused a FD with an amplitude of 3 % in the low-energy cosmic ray measurements at HET and 2 % in a comparable channel of the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, as well as a 1 % decrease in neutron monitor measurements. Significant differences are observed in the expansion behavior of the CME at different locations, which may be related to influence of the following high speed solar wind stream. Under certain assumptions, ForbMod is able to reproduce the observed FDs in low-energy cosmic ray measurements from HET as well as CRaTER, but with the same input parameters, the results do not agree with the FD amplitudes at higher energies measured by neutron monitors on Earth. We study these discrepancies and provide possible explanations. Conclusions. This study highlights that the novel measurements of the Solar Orbiter can be coordinated with other spacecraft to improve our understanding of space weather in the inner heliosphere. Multi-spacecraft observations combined with data-based modeling are also essential to understand the propagation and evolution of CMEs as well as their space weather impacts.

    Context. Solar Orbiter, launched in February 2020, started its cruise phase in June 2020, in coincidence with its first perihelion at 0.51 au from the
    Sun. The in situ instruments onboard, including the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), operate continuously during the cruise phase enabling the
    observation of solar energetic particles.
    Aims. In situ measurements of the first near-relativistic solar electron events observed in July 2020 by EPD are analyzed and the solar origins and
    the conditions for the interplanetary transport of these particles investigated.
    Methods. Electron observations from keV energies to the near-relativistic range were combined with the detection of type III radio bursts and
    extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from multiple spacecraft in order to identify the solar origin of the electron events. Electron anisotropies
    and timing as well as the plasma and magnetic field environment were evaluated to characterize the interplanetary transport conditions.
    Results. All electron events were clearly associated with type III radio bursts. EUV jets were also found in association with all of them except
    one. A diversity of time profiles and pitch-angle distributions was observed. Different source locations and different magnetic connectivity and
    transport conditions were likely involved. The July 11 event was also detected by Wind, separated 107 degrees in longitude from Solar Orbiter.
    For the July 22 event, the Suprathermal Electron and Proton (STEP) sensor of EPD allowed for us to not only resolve multiple electron injections
    at low energies, but it also provided an exceptionally high pitch-angle resolution of a very anisotropic beam. This, together with radio observations
    of local Langmuir waves suggest a very good magnetic connection during the July 22 event. This scenario is challenged by a high-frequency
    occultation of the type III radio burst and a nominally non-direct connection to the source; therefore, magnetic connectivity requires further
    investigation.

  abstract = 	{Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are clouds of plasma and magnetic field regularly ejected from the Sun at high speeds that propagate out into interplanetary space. These events are one of the most important space weather phenomena.
Their strong and turbulent magnetic field can cause disruptions of spacecraft electronics as well as terrestrial infrastructure, and they can be associated with the acceleration of energetic particles, which may cause increased radiation exposure, e.g. for astronauts.
To be able to validate and consequently improve theoretical models predicting the arrival of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at Earth and other locations in the heliosphere, it is important to employ many different data sources measuring the various signatures of ICMEs at different locations, so that their temporal and radial evolution can be studied. These investigations are also significantly aided by observations from remote sensing telescopes, which can directly observe the global structure of the ICMEs and track them out to large radial distances.

The studies presented in this thesis introduce Mars into the framework of routinely available locations for the in situ observation of space weather. Here, ICMEs can be detected using Forbush decrease measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. Forbush decreases are short-term decreases in the galactic cosmic ray flux caused by the magnetic structure of the ICME partly shielding away the cosmic rays.
The measurements of these Forbush decreases are utilized in this thesis to determine ICME arrival times for statistical studies of events seen at two planets, Earth and Mars, or at one of the two STEREO spacecraft and Mars, during close longitudinal alignment.
The measurements show for the first time that fast ICMEs can continue to decelerate beyond the orbit of Earth due to their interaction with the slower ambient solar wind.
Using remote sensing observations from the STEREO heliospheric imagers, we study additional ICMEs that hit Mars and benchmark the accuracy of different approaches for the analysis of these heliospheric imager data.
Subsequently, the Forbush decrease data for the thereby cataloged events are further investigated to infer not only the arrival time, but also more information about the radial evolution of the ICME properties by comparison with analytical modeling approaches.

Finally, two case studies are performed: First, the major space weather events of September 2017 and their impact on Mars are examined, including the investigation of the solar energetic particle events and three associated CMEs that interacted and merged on their way towards Mars. Second, the first in situ observations of an ICME at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, which launched in February 2020, are presented. In this study, we describe the capabilities of the Solar Orbiter's High Energy Telescope for high-resolution observations of Forbush decreases and use its measurements in combination with a reverse modeling approach to show that the expansion of the ICME was non-uniform, possibly due to interaction with a following solar wind stream interaction region.},

    Context. The Solar Orbiter spacecraft cruised in the inner heliosphere during Feb. 2020 – Jan. 2021, moving between ~0.5-1.0 au
    radial distance. The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) suite operated continuously during this period.
    Aims. The Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS) and High Energy Telescope (HET) observations made during intervals in between
    transient intensity increases were used to determine the low energy ion spectra and composition during quiet times.
    Methods. Energetic particle spectra and major ion components, including 3He, were measured over the range ~0.1->100
    MeV/nucleon. The radial dependence of 4.4 MeV/nucleon 4He and O was measured. A short interval of extremely low intensities
    ("super-quiet") was also studied.
    Results. Spectra measured during the quiet period showed transitions, including galactic cosmic rays (GCRs; > 50 MeV/nucleon),
    anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs; a few to ~50 MeV/nucleon), and a steeply rising "turn-up" spectrum below a few MeV/nucleon whose
    composition resembled impulsive, 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The radial dependence had large uncertainties but
    was consistent with a small gradient. During the super-quiet interval, the higher energy components remained similar to the quiet
    period, while the approximately flat low energy 4He spectrum extended downward, reaching ~300 keV/nucleon before transitioning
    to a steeply rising spectrum.

    abstract = {Aims. We aim to locate the origin of a stealth coronal mass ejection (CME) detected in situ by the MAG instrument on board Solar
Orbiter, and make connections between the CME observed at the Sun, and the interplanetary CME (ICME) measured in situ.
Methods. Remote sensing data are analysed using advanced image processing techniques to identify the source region of the stealth
CME, and the global magnetic field at the time of the eruption is examined using Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models. The
observations of the stealth CME at the Sun are compared with the magnetic field measured by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, and plasma
properties measured by the Wind spacecraft.
Results. The source of the CME is found to be a quiet Sun cavity in the northern hemisphere. We find that the stealth CME has a
strong magnetic field in situ, despite originating from a quiet Sun region with an extremely weak magnetic field.
Conclusions. The interaction of the ICME with its surrounding environment is the likely cause of a higher magnetic field strength
measured in situ. Stealth CMEs require multi-wavelength and multi-viewpoint observations in order to confidently locate the source
region, however their elusive signatures still pose many problems for space weather forecasting. The findings have implications for
Solar Orbiter observing sequences with instruments such as EUI that are designed to capture stealth CMEs.},

    The Solar Orbiter flyby of Venus on 27 December 2020 allowed for an opportunity to measure the suprathermal to energetic ions in the Venusian
    system over a large range of radial distances to better understand the acceleration processes within the system and provide a characterization
    of galactic cosmic rays near the planet. Bursty suprathermal ion enhancements (up to ~10 keV) were observed as far as ~50 RV downtail. These
    enhancements are likely related to a combination of acceleration mechanisms in regions of strong turbulence, current sheet crossings, and boundary
    layer crossings, with a possible instance of ion heating due to ion cyclotron waves within the Venusian tail. Upstream of the planet, suprathermal
    ions are observed that might be related to pick-up acceleration of photoionized exospheric populations as far as 5 RV upstream in the solar wind as
    has been observed before by missions such as Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Venus Express. Near the closest approach of Solar Orbiter, the Galactic
    Cosmic Ray (GCR) count rate was observed to decrease by approximately 5 percent, consistent with the amount of sky obscured by the planet,
    suggesting a negligible abundance of GCR albedo particles at over 2 RV . Along with modulation of the GCR population very close to Venus, the
    Solar Orbiter observations show that the Venusian system, even far from the planet, can be an effective accelerator of ions up to ~30 keV. This
    paper is part of a series of first papers from the Solar Orbiter Venus flyby; Volwerk et al. (2021) further discusses the magnetic field observations,
    Hadid et al. (2021) focuses on observations from the radio and plasma waves instrument, and Dimmock et al. (2021) focuses on characterizing
    the bow shock.

    We report observations of a relatively long period of ³He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) measured by Solar Orbiter. The period
    consists of several well-resolved ion injections. The high-resolution STEREO-A imaging observations reveal that the injections coincide
    with EUV jets/brightenings near the east limb, not far from the nominal magnetic connection of Solar Orbiter. The jets originated
    in two adjacent, large, and complex active regions as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory when the regions rotated to the
    Earth’s view. It appears that the sustained ion injections were related to the complex configuration of the sunspot group and the long
    period of 3He-rich SEPs to the longitudinal extent covered by the group during the analyzed time period.
